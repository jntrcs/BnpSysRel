##Simulation questions:

#1. Are the posterior estimates asymptotically consistent in complex systems with
#both parallel and series components

#steps:
# a. Create reliability diagrams for the system we want to test
# b. Define each components true DGD (data generating distribution, eg. rnorm(5,4))
# c. Define priors for each component
# d. Generate data using DGD
# e. Calculate posterior
# f. Compare estimates of F(t) in the middle and tails
# g. Track variance of estimates for various levels of data.
